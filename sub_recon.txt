1)gather all subdomains with assetfinder,crtsh,findomain,amass,subfinder,new_scripts,sublister,altdns.
1.2)use dnsgen to generate combinations of domains dnsgen all.txt
	it can also be used with masscan:- cat domains.txt | dnsgen - | massdns -r /home/venom/tools/subdomain_bruteforce/dnsgen/resolvers.txt -t A -o J — flush 2>/dev/null
2)Probe them all
3)to get more url throw all.txt | waybackurls | tee -a wb_urls.txt
4)get all js files with getJS https://github.com/003random/getJS usage:- cat domains.txt|getJS|tojson
5)Shodan -

Ports:8443, 8080
Title: “Dashboard[Jenkins]”
Product: Tomcat
Hostname: example.com
Org: google
ssl:Google

To find jenkins instance in a target:

org:{org name;x-jenkins:200}

6)Github For Recon

• Github is extremely helpful in finding Sensitive information regarding the targets. Access-keys, password, open endings, s3 buckets, backup files, etc. can be found on public GitHub repositories.

• Look for below things during a general first assessment(taken from edoverflow):

– API and key. (Get some more endpoints and find API keys.)

– token

– secret

– TODO

– password

– vulnerable 😜

– http:// & https://

Then I will focus on terms that make me smile when developers mess things up:

– CSRF

– random

– hash

– MD5, SHA-1, SHA-2, etc.

– HMAC

7)use linkfinder to discover endpoints from js files.

vulners nmap script to find vulnerabilities installation
git clone https://github.com/scipag/vulscan scipag_vulscan
ln -s `pwd`/scipag_vulscan /usr/share/nmap/scripts/vulscan    
To run:- nmap -sV --script=vulscan/vulscan.nse www.example.com
